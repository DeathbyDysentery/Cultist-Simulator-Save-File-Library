"Installation" instructions:

-Download one of the saves; they're all .txt files

-Navigate to your saves folder at C:\Users\[User]\AppData\LocalLow\Weather Factory\Cultist Simulator
(The game has a button on the main menu which will open it for you)

-Replace save.txt in that folder with the new file; 
when you select 'Continue' from the main menu the game will always load the file named "save.txt", whatever that is, 
which means you have to rename or remove your current save.

-Obviously, backing up your old save may be prudent; 
renaming it "oldsave.txt" and leaving it in the folder seems to be sufficient; 
as long as it isn't named "save.txt" or "backup_save[1-5].txt" the game won't touch it.
